We'll work through the materials here in the week 4 directory of the seminar repository: [https://github.com/ucberkeley/bbd-seminar-fall-2017](https://github.com/ucberkeley/bbd-seminar-fall-2017).

Or here's a [zip file](https://github.com/ucberkeley/bbd-seminar-fall-2017/archive/master.zip).

Please open parallel.html.

This material is essentially an R-focused subset of the material in two tutorials I've prepared, [one for parallel computing on one computer or node (shared memory)](https://github.com/berkeley-scf/tutorial-parallel-basics) and [one for parallel computing on multiple nodes (distributed memory)](https://github.com/berkeley-scf/tutorial-parallel-distributed).

Those two materials are generally kept up-to-date, so may be a better long-term reference.

Finally, Nima has prepared some materials on the `future` package. Here are [some slides](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~nhejazi/present/2017_futuRe_intro/2017_futuRe_intro.html#1) and here is a [Github repo](https://github.com/nhejazi/talk_futuRe-intro).
